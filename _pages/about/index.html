Larsson</a> and <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/zhech93" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zheng Chen</a> on decentralized machine learning.</p> <p>Previously, I completed my PhD at <a href="https://team.inria.fr/neo/team-members/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Inria, France</a>, working with <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Giovanni Neglia</a> on federated learning.</p> <p>My research focuses on designing scalable distributed algorithms for efficient use of data and system resources. I employ mathematical tools from distributed optimization and statistical learning theory.</p> <p>In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. Also, I happened to live in Nice and do speak <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/586584704178688/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">French</a>.</p> </body></html>
