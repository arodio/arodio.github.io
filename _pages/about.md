I am a post-doctoral researcher at *[Linköping University, Sweden](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy/ks)*,  working with *[Erik G. Larsson](https://liu.se/en/employee/erila39)* and *[Zheng Chen](https://liu.se/en/employee/zhech93)* on *decentralized machine learning*. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at *[Inria, France](https://team.inria.fr/neo/team-members/)*, working with [Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/) on *federated learning*. 

My research focuses on designing scalable distributed algorithms for efficient use of data and system resources. I employ mathematical tools from distributed optimization and statistical learning theory.
