Hej, thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [LinkÃ¶ping University, Sweden](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy/ks), working with [Erik G. Larsson](https://liu.se/en/employee/erila39) and [Zheng Chen](https://liu.se/en/employee/zhech93) on decentralized machine learning. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at [Inria, France](https://team.inria.fr/neo/team-members/), working with [Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/) on federated learning. 

My research focuses on designing scalable distributed algorithms for efficient use of data and system resources. I employ mathematical tools from distributed optimization and statistical learning theory.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. Also, I happened to live in Nice and do speak [French](https://www.facebook.com/groups/586584704178688/).
